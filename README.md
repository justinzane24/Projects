# Justin Feathers ‚Äì Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a collection of data science and machine learning projects that reflect my skills in real-world problem solving, model development, and data storytelling. Each project includes a clearly documented Jupyter notebook and a `README.md` summarizing the problem, approach, and results.

## How to Navigate

Each project folder contains:

- **A Jupyter Notebook**: Step-by-step walkthrough of the project
- **README.md**: A short summary of the problem, dataset, methods, and results  
- **Visualizations**: Included in the notebooks for key insights and model evaluation  

You can browse them using GitHub's file viewer or clone the repo to run them locally.
